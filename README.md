# Accounting-System
A C++ console application made as project for my university.
Object oriented programming design.
It was required to make a simple accountng system for a shop.
The code is not efficient at all and uses lots of classes in places where they're not neccessary. But it was required to create the classes in this manner.
Still has few problems when reading data from the user sometimes, but it's going to stay this way because i don't think it's worth wasting time on it and this isn't the aim of the course.
